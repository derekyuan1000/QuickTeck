Good morning Chloe,<br />
The email was sent to chloe4479@hotmail.co.uk.<br />
For the alternative chip, the purchasing time of 300 units will be around 2~3 weeks.<br />
We will do our best to accelerate the rebuild process (the repair process will take loner as the parcel should be put in quarantine for at least two weeks).<br />
Meanwhile, we have issued you a Â£30 discount voucher which can be used for your next job.<br />
Really sorry for any inconvenience this has caused.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
 <br />

Good morinng Chloe,<br />
We are working on the rebuild job now.<br />
However, our supplier informed us that th IC (HT16K33) is out of stock and the purchasing time can't be confirmed right now.<br />
Shall we use the VH16K33 one to replace it?<br />
Attached is the datasheet for your reference.<br />
For this alternative IC, the function is compatiable but just need you to confirm.<br />
Look forward to receiving your confirmation.<br />
<br />
