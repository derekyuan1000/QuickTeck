Hi,<br />

<br />
Your website is great in terms of design and content. However, it doesn't<br />
follow Search Engine Guidelines. So, it has a very low visibility in search<br />
results.<br />
<br />
We'd like to inform you a very important issue regarding your website which<br />
is the reason why you are losing lots of traffic. <br />
<br />
We've done a thorough SEO audit of your website, and found that it has a big<br />
potential to generate more revenue than what it might be earning at the<br />
present. And yes, we have generated a report for the same as well. And also<br />
we found best keyword suiting your business.<br />
<br />
We'd be glad to share the SEO audit report and your keywords with you so<br />
that you can check it yourself and find out what should be done to make it<br />
SEO friendly.<br />
<br />
If you are interested in audit and keywords recommendation report, please<br />
reply to this email and one of our consultants will share the report.<br />
<br />
I'm waiting for your prompt reply.<br />
<br />
Thanks & Regards,<br />
<br />
