Hello David,<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
How are you?<br />
<br />
I tried to call you just now, but couldn't get a hold of you.<br />
<br />
I'm glad to hear from your colleague that you are busy now.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
It was just a courtesy call as we've not heard from you for a while and<br />
hoping 2020 has not been too hard on you and Contrel.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
How are you in these surreal times?<br />
<br />
I wish you continued business growth in the coming months. Do let us know if<br />
we can be of any assistance.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Best Wishes<br />
<br />
Miriam Lebon<br />
