Subject: RFQ for Duet 2 Ethernet Module V1.06 x 1600pcs<br />
Hi Team<br />
<br />
Please quote me for supply and delivery to us at Workspace House PE2 7JE of 1600 pcs (80 panels 20-up) of the attached DuetEthernet_v1.06_CAM.zip. This is a revised version of our Order No QB030791 of 17/03/2020 and should be to the same specification and panelised the same way. We will require the panelised Gerber for our assemblers as they prefer to order their own stencil. <br />
<br />
Please quote for all available lead times, as this is urgently required.<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
<br />
