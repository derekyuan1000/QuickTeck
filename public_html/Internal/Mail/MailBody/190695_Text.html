Good Afternoon,<br />
With much of the UK and Europe imminently facing tighter lockdown<br />
restrictions, now more than ever businesses need to be able to sell<br />
their products and services remotely to ensure their survival.<br />
So how do you set your sales process up for success?<br />
<br />
Join me next week when I will be revealing how your business can sell<br />
remotely in times of COVID-19... and beyond!<br />
<br />
Back in 2014 I co-founded Salesflare after becoming frustrated at the<br />
amount of time and effort our CRM system was taking to manage and<br />
update. With data constantly coming through via email, phone, calendar<br />
etc, we needed a system that could automatically gather it all together<br />
in single place and let us focus on running the business. Since then<br />
Salesflare has gone on to become the most popular CRM on Product Hunt<br />
and is consistently top rated for its ease of use and automation<br />
features.<br />
<br />
During this session I'll be covering how to spend less time inputting<br />
data so you can make more sales, ensure that your team is working<br />
together as one, and never miss a follow-up again!<br />
