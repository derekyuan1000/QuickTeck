Hello Tang,<br />
<br />
our CAD software generates automatically Gerber files for both sides even if there is nothing on one side. So that is normal that you found only data for the top layer (and you can produce the boards that way)<br />
<br />
Please use RED color for the solder mask<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
Benoit<br />

Good morning Benoit,<br />
Thanks for your order.<br />
We will start the manufacturing with top silkscreen layer only as just the outline information was found on bottom silkscreen layer.<br />
Meanwhile, can you please confirm the solder mak color should be Green or Red?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
