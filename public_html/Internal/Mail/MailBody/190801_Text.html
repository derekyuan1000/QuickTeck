Hello Steve,<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
I hope this email finds you and your business well, despite these surreal<br />
times.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Brian McCrory recommended you may be the right person to contact.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
We have been manufacturing PCBs for Omnicom / Balfour Beatty since 2012 and<br />
our usual contact is Richard Thorpe.<br />
<br />
I called last week to catch up with Richard, to touch base, provide updates<br />
and see if there is anything we can do to support.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
I was advised that Richard no longer works for Balfour Beatty directly. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Can you advise, who will be our contact moving forward?<br />
<br />
For future reference also, please advise whether Richard still represents<br />
Balfour Beatty and is permitted access to previous order information/design<br />
files?<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
I look forward to hearing from you.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Kind Regards,<br />
<br />
Miriam Lebon<br />
