The Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CBILS) has been<br />
extended until the end of November!<br />
<br />
 If your business is looking to apply for a Coronavirus Business<br />
Interruption Loan, then now is the best time to do so. With more and<br />
more businesses applying through the scheme, be sure to get your<br />
application in before it's too late!<br />
<br />
 From 1st December costs will likely increase and personal guarantees<br />
will come back to the market, so if you are looking to inject some<br />
much needed working capital into the business then be sure to get your<br />
application in before 30th November<br />
