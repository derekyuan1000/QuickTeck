Hi Mark,<br />
We have received a call from your side and they won't pay until the outstanding query was sorted.<br />
It seems that they were referring to the issue which has been solved already.<br />
Can you please help to check and inform your colleague that it is OK to arrange the payment now.<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />
Have a nice weekend.<br />
<br />

Good moring mark,<br />
Thanks for your order.<br />
We will add the V-scorling line in the middle of both boards so that we can separate them easily.<br />
Since two small boards were put on one panel and the dimensions are larger than 80mm*80mm, normally extra charge will be applied.<br />
More information about our panel service can be found by the following link.<br />

<br />
After checked with our manager, we will wipe off the price difference for current job.<br />
