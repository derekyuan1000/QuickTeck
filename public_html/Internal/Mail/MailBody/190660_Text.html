Hi Chloe,<br />
That's odd as I thought I have sent the email to you already.<br />
Since the chip is out of stock in the market now, we have to use an alternative part.<br />
They are same in specification but just need your confirmation.<br />
Please check attachment for more details.<br />
Meanwhile, I think the quantity should be 250, not 300.<br />
Can you please advise for the extra 50?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
 <br />
