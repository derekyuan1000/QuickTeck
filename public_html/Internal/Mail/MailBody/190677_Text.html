Good morning Mayur<br />
The tube was used to hold the wires so they won't need to be twisted.<br />
Please check attachment for more details.<br />
Can you please check and confirm if you have the pick&place file as well？<br />
Attached is the invoice of this job.<br />
Can you please arrange the components cost of £7651.8 at your convenience?<br />

Hi Mayur,<br />
Sorry for the confusion.<br />
The service fee comes from two factors: <br />
1---Shipping fee (20%)<br />
2---High import tax(charged by China custom) due to the high components value (80%). <br />
We understand this is a big charge and our business developing team is working on this and hopefully we will find a better way for this kind of free issue parts in the near future. <br />
Sorry for this inconvenience. We always working hard to find a best way to keep our customer's cost down while keep the qualtiy highest. <br />
<br />
The updated Gerber data has passed our DRC check.<br />
Please check the plot of this new file as per attachment.<br />
The final components cost will be sent to you tomorrow.<br />
Can you please confirm if the tube is OK for the twisted wires?<br />
 <br />

Please see the attached new gerbers.<br />
 <br />
The reason for free issued components is we have them in stock and we can obtain those parts almost at half price. Your service charge is more than price of 500 boards. Can you please explain why that is?<br />

Good afternoon Mayur,<br />
It is OK to free issue PIC Microchip and AS2522 Chip.<br />
But please note extra £680 will be charged as the handling and service fee.<br />
Can you please check the components file and confirm the two duplicated R57 and C53 as well?<br />
 <br />
As for the Gerber data, we found two issues need you to confirm:<br />
1---One end of some tracks are connecting nothing, do you need to update the file?<br />
2---The clearance for the pads was measured as 0.0254mm, shall we enlarge the gap for you?<br />
I have attached the board plot for checking as well.<br />
