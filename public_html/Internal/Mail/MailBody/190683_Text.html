Dear Team at quick-teck.co.uk,<br />
<br />
Not sure if you knew this but your website quick-teck.co.uk has some problems that you might want to consider looking into. I spent 2-3 minutes looking around and found:<br />
<br />
- It doesn't work properly on Mobile Phones, at all (which is how people browse the web these days).<br />
- It doesn't adjust properly when you resize the screen (Google recommends RESPONSIVE Websites rather than ADAPTIVE)<br />
- It's hard to read on larger displays<br />
- The design looks really, really dated compared to some of your competitors.<br />
<br />
I actually do web design as a living so I figured I'd reach out and let you know there's serious room for dead easy(and affordable) improvement. If you would like, I can send you some of my previous work samples.<br />
<br />
I can develop the website on a more advanced platform at an affordable price. That price also includes making it complete mobile responsive which will support all modern devices including all ranges of screen sizes.<br />
<br />
Is that something you'd be interested in?<br />
<br />
Thanks & Regards,<br />
<br />
