Hello Tank,<br />
 <br />
I am wondering is it too late to change 3 resistors (highlighted)?<br />
Sorry about this.<br />
 <br />
If not possible it’s fine, I’d have to change it later.<br />
 <br />

Hi Danny,<br />
Yes, this iscorrect and the engineer has checked the datasheet already.<br />
The manufacturing job will be started immediately once I got the payment notice from our accountant.<br />
We will call you to confirm the delivery address before sending the boards out.<br />

Hello Tank,<br />
 <br />
I think you are correct and thank you for finding out the error, I believe I downloaded the component drawing from Mouser previously…<br />
 <br />
Would you please help double confirming that this part, PJ-102AH, would fit into the hole? (Here’s the datasheet: https://www.mouser.tw/datasheet/2/670/pj_102ah-1778518.pdf)<br />
(I checked it on my side and it seems fine.., but would be graceful if you could help double checking)<br />
 <br />
We would transfer the amount across through bank transfer.<br />

I realised I made a mistake, could you please change C6 to 0.33uF with voltage rating > 10V and package size 0603. I have attached the latest gerber and the updated BOM list (update in comment).<br />
 <br />
I am happy with the rest, please update the quote and we will forward a PO soon thank you.<br />

Hello Tank,<br />
 <br />
We are quite happy with the quote from Quick-Teck, I have updated the board slightly due to some previously undecided value and errors. <br />
I have edited the excel file you sent me as well as a direct comparison between the edited list and new CAD generated BOM list.<br />
Also included the new gerber file.<br />
 <br />
To summaries the differences: <br />
C5 removed, C6 changes to 33uF, 0805, rating 16V<br />
249R need power rating of 100mW (remain 0402, if part exist)<br />
51R changed to 0603 because need >250mW (let me know if you have difficulty with 0603 at this rating I could consider 0805 footprint)<br />
All changes are highlighted in blue in both excel files(your file edited and compare file).<br />
 <br />
Could you please update the quote and we should be able to send you the PO shortly afterward.<br />
 <br />
Best Regards<br />

Hi Danny,<br />
Normally, the lead time for assembly job is 4~5 weeks.<br />
But most of our jobs had been finished within 4 weeks or even earlier.<br />
For your case, we think it shouldn't be the problem for a lead time of 4 weeks.<br />
