Hi<br />
<br />
As discussed on the phone, we will not be coming to you to flash firmware<br />
onto the remaining boards you have to be reworked due to COVID rules.<br />
<br />
However as I mentioned, there is another way to test this reworked part<br />
(U11) without firmware, though it is not quite as neat!<br />
<br />
You can manually enable the power supply (U11) by applying 3.3V to its<br />
enable pin as shown below. In this case, you will need to either use an<br />
external 3.3V supply (with a common ground with the board) or use the<br />
board's own 3.3V supply (the easiest place to find this is the left side of<br />
C81).<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Therefore the test sequence is:<br />
<br />
   1. Connect a USB cable to the board's Micro USB connector to power it<br />
   2. Temporarily connect 3.3V from either an external supply or the left<br />
   side of C81 to the bottom of the resistor highlighted above (next to the<br />
   text 'R51')<br />
   3. Measure the voltage on the right side of C52 or C88, which are just<br />
   below U11<br />
   4. If this voltage is ~3.6V then the board is fine<br />
<br />
If the above is not something you are able to do then we will have to go<br />
with 'plan B' and ask you to modify 10 boards and return them to Spacelab<br />
for testing.<br />
<br />
Regarding the outstanding invoice, that should be paid by now, or at least<br />
is in the process of being sorted!<br />
<br />
<br />
Kind regards<br />
<br />
