Hello!<br />
<br />
I am emailing to ask for a quote. I would like to get 10 units of a PCB prototype made.<br />
I have attached the BOM, gerbers and documents to this email.<br />
PCM size is 181x87mm.<br />
<br />
Please could you let me know how much it would cost for a turn-key order of this. 10 units, PCB printed, components sourced, and assembled?<br />
<br />
Thank you!<br />
<br />
-Cameron<br />
