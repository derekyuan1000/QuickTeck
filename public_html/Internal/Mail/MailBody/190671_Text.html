Good morning Jan,<br />
As scheduled, the boards will be released from the factory this Tuesday and then to be delivered to you today.<br />
However, the manufacturing job was not finished until yesterday.<br />
Though it is on the way to our UK office now, it will be delivered to you by next Tuesday.<br />
As the compensation, a 10% (up to 50 GBP) should be issued to you once the parcel was delivered to you.<br />
Really sorry for any inconvenience this may cause.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
 <br />
   Regards<br />
