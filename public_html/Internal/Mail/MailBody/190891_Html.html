The side panel will have to run power internally to power 2 screens and an amazon fire stick concealed in the unit. One screen is used to allow customers to play games or watch&nbsp;television in the chair the other screen is a 7inch advertising screen directly below, displaying ads powered by the amazon fire stick.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Working with a friend who is an electrical engineer I managed to get a functioning prototype during lockdown, the prototype board did not work as we hoped but it does run ok as a demo. My friend has since gone back to work after working on the project with me during furlough, leaving me to find a viable solution before we take it to market. I am currently pursuing a patent so cannot begin trading until&nbsp;our attorneys have filed for that, which will be another 3 weeks from today, and then we will be putting a 6-8 week lead time on our first batch of orders to give us plenty of lee-way to familiarise ourselves with the production process. This would give you around 8-9 weeks to modify our design, create a working side-panel, and ship our first batch, please let me know if this would be a viable timeline.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The board itself is fairly simple in design, with no microprocessors or complex functionality. I will attach an early schematic of our design to give you context as to what we are looking for, on the phone the lady mentioned Gerber files but since our prototype board did not function correctly I am reluctant to share them. Our design is a simple duplicate system, one side of the PCB faces outwards allowing clients to plug-in HDMI or AUX, etc this will then be duplicated on the inside of the PCB to allow us to sync those commands with the internal driver boards connected to our monitors concealed inside the mirror. Please review the schematic if my explanation is unclear.</div><div><br></div><div>We use a 6-way wire to wire board to direct the power from our 240v input to power our internal unit electronics and will also require a transformer to convert that power.</div><div><br></div><div>We would need Two separate designs making up, one for internally wired in mirrors and one to plug into the wall for barbers who wish to save on installation. Our requirements list is as follows:</div><div>-230/240v power input</div><div>-Rocker Power switch</div><div>-HDMI</div><div>-USB type A</div><div>-AUX</div><div>-6-way wire to wire board connector</div><div>-Current transformer</div><div>-Diodes and resistors where required.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I have some ideas as to components I wish to use, we bought these from Sparkfun and RS during our prototype assembly, however, if you prefer to source your own high-quality components I am happy to trust in your expertise, if not let me know and I will share our BOM from the prototype with you.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>If you have any further questions or would like more information please feel free to give me a call on 07872857002, I will be available to answer anytime during business hours.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Look forward to hearing from you.</div><div><br></div><div>Kind Regards, Sam.&nbsp;</div></div>
