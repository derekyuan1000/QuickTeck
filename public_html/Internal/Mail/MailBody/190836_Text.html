Hi Neale,<br />
For providing five samples to you for testing, we are looking for £450 (exc VAT).<br />
Please note this cost is for bare board only as the MOQ of the LED is 5K.<br />
Extra £420 (exc VAT) will be charged if you need the Gerber data.<br />
The lead time will be around four weeks.<br />
Look forward to receiving your confirmation.<br />
<br />
