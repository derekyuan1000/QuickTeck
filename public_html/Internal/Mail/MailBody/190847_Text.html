Subject: Quote for Flexi boards<br />
Hi, <br />
 <br />
We ordered 10 flexi boards back in March from you. We want to order an updated revision of these boards to the same spec as the originals, order number QB030341.<br />
 <br />
Can you please quote us for a further 10 of the revised boards (gerbers attached) with varying lead times?<br />
 <br />
Thanks, <br />
Damien<br />
