Its not a major issue, i can see how it happened, just wanted to float the solder, but now will have to use a soldering iron. <br />
<br />
Boards are good so iâ€™m really happy with your work.<br />

Hi Darren,<br />
I think there is some confusion in your confirmation of "A green no solder mask Layer and yes".<br />
We have asked if we can ignore the layer and your answer is yes.<br />
Meanwhile, we did not find the solder mask information in the sample image you provided.<br />
So we did not apply it.<br />
Hope you can understand this.<br />
After talked with our manager, we can provide a 5% discount voucher and you can use this for your next job.<br />
Look forward to receiving your confirmation.<br />
<br />
<br />

Good morning Darren,<br />
For the image, I can confirm NO solder mask was applied and we just covered the tracks with Tin.<br />
I have checked the previous record and found you have agreed about this.<br />
Can you please recheck this?<br />
We can apply the solder mask for further boards if needed.<br />
