Hi Team<br />
<br />
Please quote me for supply and delivery to us at Workspace House PE2 7JE of<br />
1600 pcs (80 panels 20-up) of the attached *DuetEthernet_v1.06_CAM.zip. *This<br />
is a revised version of our Order No QB030791 of 17/03/2020 and should be<br />
to the same specification and panelised the same way. We will require the<br />
panelised Gerber for our assemblers as they prefer to order their own<br />
stencil.<br />
<br />
Please quote for all available lead times, as this is urgently required.<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
<br />
Roland<br />
