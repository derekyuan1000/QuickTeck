Hi,<br />
<br />
We ordered 10 flexi boards back in March from you. We want to order an updated revision of these boards to the same spec as the originals, order number QB030341.<br />
<br />
Can you please quote us for a further 10 of the revised boards (gerbers attached) with varying lead times?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
