Hi,<br />
<br />
I spoke to a member of your team on the phone briefly about my project and<br />
it sounds like you may be able to help me.<br />
<br />
I am looking for a company that can design and create a PCB board to<br />
function as a side panel inside my new product, a digital Smart mirror for<br />
barbershops and salons. The side panel will have to run power internally to<br />
power 2 screens and an amazon fire stick concealed in the unit. One screen<br />
is used to allow customers to play games or watch television in the chair<br />
the other screen is a 7inch advertising screen directly below, displaying<br />
ads powered by the amazon fire stick.<br />
<br />
Working with a friend who is an electrical engineer I managed to get a<br />
functioning prototype during lockdown, the prototype board did not work as<br />
we hoped but it does run ok as a demo. My friend has since gone back to<br />
work after working on the project with me during furlough, leaving me to<br />
find a viable solution before we take it to market. I am currently pursuing<br />
a patent so cannot begin trading until our attorneys have filed for that,<br />
which will be another 3 weeks from today, and then we will be putting a 6-8<br />
week lead time on our first batch of orders to give us plenty of lee-way to<br />
familiarise ourselves with the production process. This would give you<br />
around 8-9 weeks to modify our design, create a working side-panel, and<br />
ship our first batch, please let me know if this would be a viable<br />
timeline.<br />
<br />
The board itself is fairly simple in design, with no microprocessors or<br />
complex functionality. I will attach an early schematic of our design to<br />
give you context as to what we are looking for, on the phone the lady<br />
mentioned Gerber files but since our prototype board did not function<br />
correctly I am reluctant to share them. Our design is a simple duplicate<br />
system, one side of the PCB faces outwards allowing clients to plug-in HDMI<br />
or AUX, etc this will then be duplicated on the inside of the PCB to allow<br />
us to sync those commands with the internal driver boards connected to our<br />
monitors concealed inside the mirror. Please review the schematic if my<br />
explanation is unclear.<br />
<br />
We use a 6-way wire to wire board to direct the power from our 240v input<br />
to power our internal unit electronics and will also require a transformer<br />
to convert that power.<br />
<br />
We would need Two separate designs making up, one for internally wired in<br />
mirrors and one to plug into the wall for barbers who wish to save on<br />
installation. Our requirements list is as follows:<br />
-230/240v power input<br />
-Rocker Power switch<br />
-HDMI<br />
-USB type A<br />
-AUX<br />
-6-way wire to wire board connector<br />
-Current transformer<br />
-Diodes and resistors where required.<br />
<br />
I have some ideas as to components I wish to use, we bought these from<br />
Sparkfun and RS during our prototype assembly, however, if you prefer to<br />
source your own high-quality components I am happy to trust in your<br />
expertise, if not let me know and I will share our BOM from the prototype<br />
with you.<br />
<br />
If you have any further questions or would like more information please<br />
feel free to give me a call on 07872857002, I will be available to answer<br />
anytime during business hours.<br />
<br />
Look forward to hearing from you.<br />
<br />
Kind Regards, Sam.<br />
