Hi Tank, <br />
 <br />
The part number for the regulator in the third row is TPS61090<br />
https://www.ti.com/product/TPS61090<br />
 <br />
The other two queried part numbers are correct. For the LED, any standard LED with that footprint will suffice. For the last two entries, these are both just holes of a certain size in a certain pattern. There is no specific part that needs to be fitted for those, <br />
 <br />
Best regards<br />
Adam <br />

Hi Adam,<br />
They are just the PCB manufacturing costs with different lead time.<br />
Please send us your BOM if you need the assembly quotation as well.<br />
It will be better if you can use our template.<br />
Yes, the invoice will be sent to you for payment once everything was cleared.<br />

Good afternoon, <br />
 <br />
Yes, there are no pads in those highlighted areas, so there shouldn’t be any solder paste there. I have a few questions: (1) is this price for both fabrication and assembly? (2) will quick-teck supply the components, and if so how does that affect price and lead time?, (3) are you able to send us an invoice so that we can pay via a purchase order from UCL? <br />
 <br />
Thank you, <br />
 <br />
Best regards <br />

Good afternoon Adam,<br />
Thanks for your order.<br />
Please note the board dimension was measured as 40.5mm*162.3mm.<br />
You may know extra charge will be applied for this kind of panel job.<br />
For this 7-up panel job, we charge £253.06 (exc. VAT) based on 6-day option.<br />
We will just charge £169.77 (exc. VAT) if you can change the lead time to 9-day option.<br />
As for the Gerber data, we did not find the related pads for the highlighted areas.<br />
