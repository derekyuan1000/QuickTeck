Subject: Instructions for testing re-worked boards<br />
Hi<br />
<br />
As discussed on the phone, we will not be coming to you to flash firmware onto the remaining boards you have to be reworked due to COVID rules.<br />
<br />
However as I mentioned, there is another way to test this reworked part (U11) without firmware, though it is not quite as neat!<br />
<br />
You can manually enable the power supply (U11) by applying 3.3V to its enable pin as shown below. In this case, you will need to either use an external 3.3V supply (with a common ground with the board) or use the board's own 3.3V supply (the easiest place to find this is the left side of C81).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Therefore the test sequence is:<br />
Connect a USB cable to the board's Micro USB connector to power it<br />
Temporarily connect 3.3V from either an external supply or the left side of C81 to the bottom of the resistor highlighted above (next to the text 'R51')<br />
Measure the voltage on the right side of C52 or C88, which are just below U11<br />
If this voltage is ~3.6V then the board is fine<br />
If the above is not something you are able to do then we will have to go with 'plan B' and ask you to modify 10 boards and return them to Spacelab for testing.<br />
<br />
Regarding the outstanding invoice, that should be paid by now, or at least is in the process of being sorted!<br />
<br />
<br />
Kind regards<br />
<br />
Angus<br />
