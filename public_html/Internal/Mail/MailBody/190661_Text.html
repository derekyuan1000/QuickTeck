yes I had to put actual value on the screens because that is what they cost me and if they got lost or damaged I would have to file an insurance claim.Secondly I have found that if you undervalue packages UK customs will assess the value and charge what they feel is the appropriate tax anyway. As soon as you pick up the package you will see there is a prototype board that works fine with the software and video clip, but none of the manufactured boards work properly. That is what I find frustrating.you sent me a prototype that works , but the parts I actually paid you for dont work.Do you have an idea how long it will be before we get an answer from the factory? I have customers that I have had to cancel orders from and I have  a lot of interest in this screen.    <br />

Hi Carl,<br />
Yes, we have tested the boards with two versions, with and without the potentiometer.<br />
This is why we thought the issue should come from other section.<br />
The import tax should be caused by the high declare value of USD 800.<br />
We will send the samples to our factory and keep you updated.<br />

No I dont thinks its the software or the video clip.The first screen the factory sent me to test (on the blue circuit board) has the exact same software as the other screens and the exact same sd card with video clip was used for the examples I sent you.When you receive the package I sent look at the video quality from the prototype board( on the blue board)  and you will see it is far superior to the green boards.The only thing that changed was adding the potentiometer. my guess is when the potentiometer was added it has caused a problem.Did the factory build another prototype like the first one they sent me? or did they just build the version with the potentiometer? <br />
<br />
Unless the code has been corrupted at the factory, but you have the original software and they can use that to load onto the arduino chip.<br />
<br />
<br />
On the tracking it say the package is available for pickup.Maybe the local post office is holding on to it and you need to call them to get it delivered?<br />

Hi Carl,<br />
We haven't received it yet.<br />
So it is hard to check the paper file of the tax.<br />
But the key problem is that we have tested with different LCD from different suppliers, different cards and both versions of boards in our factory, none of them is good.<br />
So we thought this is not the issue of LCD or boards.<br />
It should be the problem of the video or software as the video was made by lots of pictures (low quality).<br />
We will send the bad and good samples you stated to our factory for further investigating once they were arrived at our office.<br />
