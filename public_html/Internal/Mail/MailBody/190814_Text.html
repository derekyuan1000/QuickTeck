Good afternoon to you,<br />
<br />
Trust I find you well.<br />
<br />
I called a moment ago to discuss and qualify an sales lead which had been sent from one of my offices in China to discuss imports etc. May I ask do you import from the Far East and would you be interested in receiving competitive rates?<br />
<br />
Looking forward to hearing back from you soon.<br />
<br />
Have a good day.<br />
<br />
Best regards/Med vänlig hälsning<br />
