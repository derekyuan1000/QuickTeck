Hi there,<br />
 <br />
I hope this email finds you well!<br />

I wanted to reach out because one of our local members mentioned this may be of interest to you and was kind enough to pass on your details.<br />
 <br />
W1G’s Knebworth Golf Club platform can help you and the team at Quick-Teck Electronics. We have an opportunity to offer you some referrals from the members and visitors. <br />

- Establishing networking opportunities for you with the other 20+ business partners.<br />
- Complimentary golf for you to entertain clients, colleagues and guests.<br />
<br />
Even though some restrictions are being tightened, golf remains one of the best socially-distant sports, making your local golf club the perfect place to promote Quick-Teck Electronics .<br />
<br />
Golf clubs were among the first sports facilities to be reopened after the initial lockdown, and footfall at Knebworth Golf Club is still at record levels. Take advantage of this unique partnership opportunity now and we'll give you an extra 2 months free, plus you can spread the cost to make it more affordable.<br />
<br />
