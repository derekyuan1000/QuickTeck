Hello Tank,<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I have just had a quote request via telephone from Martin, from Creative Retail Lighting (01636705512)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Martin needs a quote to re-order QB030621 (just small change, as already agreed below).<br />
<br />
He needs 1000 units as usual of this assembly order. He needs half of this (500 units) asap.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Please can you<br />
<br />
*        Send Martin a quote<br />
<br />
*        Confirm in writing to him that this will include the change to 4x 2.5 AMP fuses (as per the email below).  Pleaes note, If they are made with 4 AMP fuses like the previous orders they will be useless to him.<br />
<br />
*        Confirm her can pay in the usual way. Martins says that he usually pays 50% upfront and 50% after delivery.<br />
<br />
*        Confirm regarding lead-time for<br />
<br />
o   A)the first 500<br />
<br />
o   B) the total order<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Any questions, please feel free to contact me.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Best Wishes<br />

Subject: RE: ILFB3<br />
<br />
Hello all,<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
We would like to order another 1000 x ILFB3 units from you but with 1 minor change please.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Can we swap the 4 x 4A fuse currently specified on the fuse holder to 4 x 2.5A please?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Can you send me a proforma and I assume we can do the same as last time by paying 50% up front and then 50% just before delivery?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Any questions, please don’t hesitate to contact me on 07585 777882<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Many thanks<br />
