Subject: Re: Re: Pedal Pawn Vybe----QB020811 invoice and payment<br />
Hi guys,<br />
<br />
Hope you’re doing well! Thank you for completing the ‘Vybe’ project for us a while back!<br />
<br />
We have now completed the first prototype, but it took us a few months to correct some issues with the board, thankfully we only ordered a few units so it wasn’t a big disaster haha<br />
<br />
We would like to do a first run of about 115.<br />
<br />
For the first change, the product will be called ‘Gypsy Vibe’ - So we need the labelling on the board to reflect this change from ‘Gypsy Vybe’ to ‘Gypsy Vibe’ please.<br />
<br />
Also, are you able to please remove any actual values labelling from the board as we don’t want competitors opening it up and easily seeing what we’re using.<br />
<br />
Below you can see the parts list, anything with a green tick means it needs to be changed to the specified part please:<br />
<br />
✅R1 - Needs to be changed to a 3.3k<br />
R2 - 4k7<br />
R3 - 2m2<br />
R4 - 1k8<br />
R5 - 4k7<br />
R6 - 1k8<br />
R7 - 470r<br />
R8 - 470r<br />
R9 - 22k<br />
✅R10 - needs to be changed to 47k<br />
R11 - 150r<br />
R12 - needs to be 4.7k<br />
✅R13 - needs to be 100k<br />
R14 - 100k<br />
R15 - 68k<br />
R16 - 47k<br />
R17 - 4.7k<br />
R18 - 4k7<br />
R19 - 220k<br />
R20 - 47k<br />
R21 - 100k<br />
✅R22 - You haven’t put a R22 on the board & it can’t be located, so this leads us to believe that the resistors after this one are all mislabelled / out of sync by one. So R23 is now R22, R24 is now 23 etc, Does this make sense?<br />
R23 - 4k7<br />
R24 - 100k<br />
R25 - 4k7<br />
R26 - 4k7<br />
R27 - 4k7<br />
R28 - 220k<br />
R29 - 100k<br />
R30 - 100k<br />
R31 - 47k<br />
R32 - 4k7<br />
R33 - 4k7<br />
R34 - 4k7<br />
R35 - 4k7<br />
R36 - 100k<br />
R37 - 4k7<br />
R38 - 100k<br />
R39 - 100k<br />
R40 - 47k<br />
R41 - 1K<br />
R42 - 3k3<br />
R43 - 5k6<br />
R44 - 47k<br />
R45 - 100k<br />
R46 - 1m2<br />
R47 - 1m2<br />
R48 - 47k<br />
R49 - 220k<br />
R50 - 100k<br />
R51 - 100k<br />
<br />
<br />
✅C1 - 1u tantulem (wasn’t on the one you sent) got to be tantulem or doesn’t work<br />
C2 - 1u<br />
C3 - 1u<br />
C4 - 1u<br />

C13 - 220n<br />
C14 - 1u<br />
C15 - 1u<br />
C16 - 1u<br />
C17 - 1u<br />
C18 - 1u<br />
C19 - 1u<br />
C20 - 330p<br />
✅C21 -  2200uF 25volt - (Will need to bigger pads on board)<br />
✅C22 - 220uF 25volt - (Will need to bigger pads on board)<br />
✅C23 - We couldn’t locate C23 although we think it might be this highlighted capacitor here? (Which we installed) If you could please confirm with us whether or not that is in fact C23 and then label it please - This should be a 1u tantulem please (needs to be Tantulem otherwise it won’t work)<br />
✅C24- 1u tantulem (needs to be Tantulem otherwise it won’t work)<br />
C25 - 4700p<br />
✅C26 - 680uF - Will need to bigger pads on board<br />
<br />
<br />
✅Q1 - Needs to be changed to 2sc839s<br />
✅Q2 - Needs to be changed to 2sc839s<br />
Q3 - 2sc536<br />
Q4 - 2sc536<br />
Q5 - 2sc536<br />
Q6 - 2sc536<br />
Q7 - 2sc536<br />
Q8 - 2sc536<br />
Q9 - 2sc536<br />
Q10 - 2sc536<br />
Q11 - 2sc536<br />
Q12 - 2sc536<br />
Q13 - 2sc536<br />
Q14 - 2sc539s<br />
<br />
Led 1 - not needed<br />
Led 2 - not needed<br />
Led 3 - not needed<br />
Led 4 - not needed<br />
Led 5 - not needed<br />
<br />
W1 - 1K preset<br />
<br />
✅D3 - replace with a wire link<br />
<br />
Would you suggest it’s wise to get one more sample board with the above changes or are you confident they will all be okay? Happy to pay for the 115 now. Thanks a lot for your hard work<br />
<br />
To finalise, here is a before and after shot of the board you sent us and then the board which we manually revised<br />
<br />
Before:<br />
<br />
After:<br />
<br />
Many thanks<br />

Hi Chris,<br />
The boards will be arrived at our UK office next Monday or Tuesday.<br />
To be honest, due to the effect of the coronavirus, all the vistors will be forbidden recently.<br />
Since you need them urgently, we can send them to you by DHL once they were delivered.<br />
Hope you can understand this.<br />
Please let us know your thinking.<br />

Hi Chris,<br />
As scheduled, our UK colleagues will work at home next week.<br />
Only 1~2 two of them will check status of the packages and then arrange the delivery accordingly.<br />
Since the working hours were uncertain, we suggest to send them out by DHL. Hope you can understand this.<br />
Any enquiries please let us know.<br />

Hi Harry,<br />
<br />
Thanks for this! I really love the fact you added the logo, thanks so much for this idea!<br />
<br />
Can I just check why there is a ‘3’ after the Product labelling, is that a mistake ha ha?<br />
<br />
I’ve just sent through another question on another email about the cell size<br />

Hi Chris,<br />
See attached as the latest drawing please:<br />
1, Extra two pads were added on the power section.<br />
2, I have put your logo on the board(if you don't like it, I will take if off, I just like it, very good design:)）<br />
3, Change the company name information as you requested<br />
4, Put the board size information in cm on the pdf.<br />
Let me know if you are happy to go ahead. I can confirm the board will be in black.<br />
<br />

Look forward to seeing this tomorrow thank you!<br />
<br />
My tech has just checked this and highlighted the board in which where we need the additional marks, he has advised there should definitely be room here?<br />
<br />
Many thanks<br />

Hi Chris,<br />
The new Layout for this Vybe project will be sent to you tomorrow.<br />
As for the Texan Twang board, it is too small and there is no space to make the change from your tech.<br />
Can you please confirm if we can keep it same as before?<br />
It is OK to provide both boards in Black and panel.<br />
Please let us know your thinking.<br />

Hi there Harry,<br />
<br />
Me and my tech have checked the board layout you have sent over, and we can work with this layout now thank you.<br />
<br />
There’s a few minor changes to be made please. We would like black PCB boards (with white writing) on this project and every other Pedal Pawn project in future please. Can you please change the writing on the PCB here to ‘Pedal Pawn ® Gypsy Vybe ™’. Also it could be handy to have 2 extra positive & negative holes if possible please.<br />
<br />
Can I please ask for the dimensions in centimetres to be added on the final draft please?<br />
<br />
Btw, I believe we’ve already paid for the 5x units above to be dispatched:<br />
n a different note, we’d like to reorder more of our two previous projects now too please. We need 160x Texan Twang boards & 100x Fuzz boards so if you can in fact invoice me for these so we can get in the queue. Are you able to send our univibe reference unit back along with this order too please?<br />
<br />
As mentioned above, we’d like these both to be black PCBs going forward too.<br />
<br />
My tech has advised an important change on the Texan Twang, “2 extra positive & negative holes for Texan twang”.<br />
<br />
Also my tech has asked on these smaller sized projects, can they come as a 3x4 matrix all in one board? Sometimes they do, sometimes they don’t.<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot for your time on this!<br />
<br />
Many thanks<br />

Hi Chris,<br />
Sorry for the delay. I have put double checked the layout yesterday and now ready to send you for checking.<br />
Please be noted:<br />
1, we will only provide 5pcs of bare board(no componnets fit on them).<br />
2,  we will charge £100(exc VAT) for these 5pcs of PCBs. This need to be paid before despatching.<br />
3, The design was based on the sample board you provided. The only changes are the power supply section. We have changed it to supporting 18V DC input. We will not take any responsibiity on any other sections.<br />
4, Please check the PCB layout carefully, let us know any comments within the next couple of days. We are thinking to put this job into manufacturing process next Monday.<br />
Any questions please let us know.<br />
Thanks.<br />

No problem. I can take these parts off the board. But how about the traces connected to these parts? Can you use the pdf file to clearly explain which parts/trackes need to be removed or modified.<br />

We fully understand the sample board and have expressed that we please don’t need ‘C21 / C22 / C23 / D1 / D2 / D3’. Does that make sense? Please just don’t include that portion?<br />

<br />
Morning Chris,<br />
Thanks. I can see what is this product used for but I can't understand how the circuit work internally. I am not an engineer in your area.<br />
 What I need is your comments on the PCB layout. This is a PCB copy job(reversing from your sample,I have also clearly mentioned this during the meeting) as we agreed.<br />
I  have already copied the PCBs as you requested and send you the layout file. This is a very standard process we have done many years here for our customers.<br />
Aagain, I must say your tech should fully understand the sample board and understand the PCB layout I provided(because its the exactly the same as the sample board) . So he should be able to easily provide comments on the 'Power supply' secion, and let me know where need to take off. I am worried if he(or you) don't understand the sample board how will you populate the components and perform the testing after you have the new board from us.<br />
OK, back to the power supply section, I have quickly looked the sample board you provided and should have understand the logic. So now, I don't mind to take couple of hours to modify that secion and replace with a 18V DC input. But I don't take responsibility for this modification, you teck should carefully check it and make sure that is what you needed.<br />
If there is any more changes rather than this 'power supply section', I am sorry I need charge my time on this job.<br />
Hi Chris, we always like to help our customer and like to make things happen. Be frankly, I would suggest your chase with your tech to review the deign carefully. I got a feeling, if he/you don't understand the PCB layout now, you will take hugh time to get the new sample board work.<br />
I normally have 3 to 5 design jobs in hand. And I need managing my 11 hours daily working time very carfully to make sure all project moving smoothly and meet the deadlines.<br />
<br />

Haha, I’m always working! ????<br />
<br />
Here’s the basic concept of a guitar pedal:<br />
<br />
<br />
And this part of the circuit diagram we don’t want, as we’re gonna to wire up our own 18v socket!<br />

Hi Chris,<br />
Thanks for your quick reply. Not expected people work so late like me:)<br />
So my understanding is: instead of using 22V AC power, you want me to modify the power supply module to use 18V DC input, am I right? This sounds more senseable for me now.<br />
I will look at this tomorrow after backing office. Meanwhile I still need to know the range of the input for this 18V DC, for example: the maximum/minimum voltage level of this input(we call this input specification).<br />
Thanks.<br />
<br />

Hiya Harry,<br />
<br />
Thanks for this message!<br />
<br />
It is a guitar pedal like the previous designs you have done for us.<br />
<br />
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_unit<br />
<br />
You’re right, we need the board completely reverse engineered though instead of using the old 60s mains adapter section, we are going to be using an 18v power supply on our design as that’s more modern and prevalent in 2020, you said you understood this in the meeting.<br />
<br />
Is that okay? We don’t want you to redesign/ add anything, we simply want the section removed<br />
<br />
Many thanks<br />

Hi Chris,<br />
Got your email. I think there is some misunderstanding between us.<br />
During our meeting, I have clearly mentioned I would do the reverse engineering on your board. I won't involve in your design details.  To be honest, even now I am still not very understand what is the function of this product. What is the product used for, I have no idea. Normally, If customer needs us to involve their design work, they will ask us to sign a NDA and they will provide us a support documents(e.g. schematic drawing, BOM, manual).<br />
On my first email, I have also mentioned we only charge the PCB layout, nothing with the redesign.<br />
What I have done is taking  photos with our specific camera and print these photos on a paper with 1:1 scale.  And then use our PCB layout software to re-track the traces.<br />
To be fair, you tech guy should understand the pdf which I send to you. He should understand how the board works, and then provide the comments on the lay out.<br />
Should you have any suggestions please let us know.<br />
Thanks.<br />

Hi Chris,<br />
Thank you for your reply.<br />
1. We need the Transistors as the same way they are on the Texan twang board , what my tech would call the ‘D’ formation -------Sorry, can you explain a bit more please?<br />
2, We don’t want the power supply included----I don't know 'Power supply' means which parts, you need tell me exactly which trackes need to take off, also please let me know do we need to keep the PCB size the same as now?<br />
3. We need All resistors 0.25w carbon film ..Transistors TO92 footprint.-----------how to change on PCB?<br />
Chris, a better way to do is,if you can work on the pdf(which shows the PCB and the tracks) and highlight which tracks need to be modified and how to do then it will be more easier for me to work on it.<br />
Thanks for your understanding.<br />

Sorry we keep the same price as 5 which is 250+100 (5pcs PCB).<br />
5 or 1 doesn't make difference for us at all. And we learned from the past build only one put risk for both of us.<br />
<br />

Given your board is 171*94mm, you can always use the following link to check the price and get your feeling.<br />

Hi Chris,<br />
From the manufacturing and cost point of view,  1pcs and 10pcs doesn't change a lot for us. We can drop the manufactruing cost to be £100(exc VAT) for 5pcs of PCBs.<br />
So totally is 250+100 (5pcs PCB).<br />
Thanks.<br />

Okay what’s the smallest amount we can order, can we order just one to start on top of the design fee?<br />
<br />
No worries on the schematic as I don’t think it’s very correct from what my tech has advised<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Many thanks<br />

Hi Peda,<br />
Thanks for your information.<br />
If you like to go with 50pcs, then it will be £305(exc VAT), as we mentioned during the meeting. But we don't suggest you go with that amount since people need a small volume to check the functions.<br />
Anyway, if you could pay the design fee, then the job will be start and we will send you PCB layout image for your checking before manufacturing.<br />
Regarding the schematic, of course I know its not for that board. Just want to take it as reference. I am fine if you think not worthy to send to me.<br />
Thanks.<br />
<br />

Hiya,<br />
<br />
Can you please rectify the QB020741 for no ‘10 units’ yet as we’d like to order 50 when we’re happy with the design please.<br />
<br />
Im not sure we should use that schematic as it was from a clone unit found on the internet and not of this very model<br />
<br />
Many thanks<br />

Hi Chris,<br />
Thanks for coming this morning. As I mentioned:<br />
1, We charge £250(exc VAT) for the PCB layout job. You will have the PCB layout file after this job done.<br />
2, We will charge £150(exc VAT) for 10pcb of blank PCBs. Then you will be able to populate these 10pcs boards with your components.<br />
<br />
You will certainly welcome use our online quote and order form to place your repeat order later. The price for the future orders can be fond from this link.<br />
https://www.quick-teck.co.uk/onlinequote/onlinequote.php<br />
<br />
Let us know if you like to go ahead, then we will send you an invoice. We need you to pay the first design fee(£250(exc VAT)) to start the job. The rest £150(exc VAT) can be paid once we start the PCB manufacturing job.<br />
Hope above makes sense.<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
