Good morning Martin,<br />
Glad to hear from you.<br />
For this updated job (with new 2.5 AMP fuses), we charge for £3660 (Inc. VAT) which includes the extra shipping fee of the second shipment.<br />
Yes, you can pay 50% to start and the balance can be made before the second shipment.<br />

Subject: QUOTE AND INFORMATION REQUEST ____FW: Re: QB030621 Invoice and Payment<br />
Hello Tank,<br />
 <br />
I have just had a quote request via telephone from Martin, from Creative Retail Lighting (01636705512) <br />
 <br />
Martin needs a quote to re-order QB030621 (just small change, as already agreed below).<br />
He needs 1000 units as usual of this assembly order. He needs half of this (500 units) asap.<br />
 <br />
Please can you<br />
·        Send Martin a quote<br />
·        Confirm in writing to him that this will include the change to 4x 2.5 AMP fuses (as per the email below).  Pleaes note, If they are made with 4 AMP fuses like the previous orders they will be useless to him.<br />
·        Confirm her can pay in the usual way. Martins says that he usually pays 50% upfront and 50% after delivery.<br />
·        Confirm regarding lead-time for <br />
o   A)the first 500<br />
o   B) the total order<br />
 <br />
Any questions, please feel free to contact me.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
Best Wishes<br />

Subject: RE: ILFB3<br />
Hello all,<br />
 <br />
We would like to order another 1000 x ILFB3 units from you but with 1 minor change please.<br />
 <br />
Can we swap the 4 x 4A fuse currently specified on the fuse holder to 4 x 2.5A please?<br />
 <br />
Can you send me a proforma and I assume we can do the same as last time by paying 50% up front and then 50% just before delivery?<br />
 <br />
Any questions, please don’t hesitate to contact me on 07585 777882<br />
 <br />
Many thanks<br />
 <br />
