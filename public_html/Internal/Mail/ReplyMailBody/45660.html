	Good morning Panos,<br />
That's odd as I have replied you already.<br />
Yes, you have paid the order. But there is a balance as you requested a larger stencil.<br />
Please check attachment for more details.<br />
You can arrange the balance through the following link at your convenience.<br />

Subject: Order QA120390<br />
<br />
Hello,<br />
<br />
I suspect there may be an issue with order QA120390.&nbsp; The website states <br />
that the order has been paid "Partly" (but it was paid in full). <br />
Moreover, there has been no other progress for two days now, e.g. I <br />
haven't received any emails with regard to the manufacturing progress, etc.<br />
<br />
Could you please look into this and let me know if there is anything I <br />
should do on my part?&nbsp; Thank you.<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />
<br />
