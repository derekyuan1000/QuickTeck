<br />
Hi Team Quick-Teck,<br />
<br />
Sorry to mess you about, but our office will be closed on the 24th Dec and we do not want to risk the PCBs being stored/lost by DHL over the Xmas/New Year. Would it be possible to change the service on this job to a 20 day laid back service?<br />
<br />
If it is possible, please credit our account or issue a credit note/voucher that we can use on our next order for the difference in price.<br />
Best regards<br />
Paul Sumpner<br />
CTO<br />
