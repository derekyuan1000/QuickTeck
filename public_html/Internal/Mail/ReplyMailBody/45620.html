<br />
Good afternoon,<br />
<br />
Can you please send me a quote for the manufacture of 30 of the PCB (RoHS lead-free) described in the attached GERBER file. Your 'laid-back' delivery schedule will be fine since I will not need the boards until after the new term starts in early January.<br />
<br />
Best Regards,<br />
<br />
