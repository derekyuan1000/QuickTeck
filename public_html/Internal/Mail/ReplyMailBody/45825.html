	Good morning Andrew,<br />
Thanks for your information.<br />
It is OK about the silkscreen layout.<br />
But please note the outer part will be ignored.<br />
I think it should be OK as long as you konw the location of this LCD display during the assembly process.<br />
Yes, you can just place the two boards closely.<br />
Please note extra charge will be applied for this kind of panel job if any board dimension is larger than 80mm*80mm.<br />
Look forward to hearing back from you soon.<br />

	Hello,<br />
<br />
My board has an LCD display which will be slightly larger than the fabricated board, for this reason the silkscreen is outside the edge cut.<br />
<br />
Does this present a manufacturing problem?<br />
<br />
Also my project consists of two boards, do I have them drawn on the same sheet next to each other?<br />
<br />
This is just a hobby project so doesn't have to be perfect!<br />
<br />
Many thanks,<br />
<br />
Andrew Fraser
