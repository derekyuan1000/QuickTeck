  <p><b>ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene)</b>--- In comparison to PLA, ABS plastic is durable, difficult to break, less 'brittle', slightly flexible. After printing, ABS has a nice smooth finish that can be easily sanded, painted, machined, or glued if necessary.</p>
  <p><b>PLA (Polylactic Acid)</b>--- PLA is biodegradable material which is biocompatibility with a human body. Comparing with ABS, it features lower warping, harder structure and odorless. PLA  shouldn't be used in places where it will be exposed to heat due to a lower melting temperature. Even the inside of a car on a hot day can cause deformation.</p>
  <p><b>Nylon</b>--- Although ABS and PLA are the two most popular 3D printing materials, Nylon is another newer one., It is not often used, but has some very unique benefits. Nylon is an incredibly strong, durable, and versatile 3D printing material. Flexible when thin, but with very high inter-layer adhesion, nylon lends itself well to things like living hinges and other functional parts. The main negative for nylon is that it is very susceptible to water. It will need to be dried before printing if it has been exposed to humidity.</p>
